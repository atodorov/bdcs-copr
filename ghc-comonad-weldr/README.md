This is the comonad package with "-weldr" stuck to the end of the name so that
it does not interfere with the Fedora version of comonad, which is broken in
Fedora 26.

This package requires the following packages not available in Fedora:

* [ghc-distributive-weldr](../ghc-distributive-weldr)

![ghc-comonad status](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/g/weldr/bdcs-haskell-deps/package/ghc-comonad/status_image/last_build.png)
