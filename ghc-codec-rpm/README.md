This module provides a library for reading RPM files and converting them into
useful data structures. There is currently no way to operate in reverse - that
is, for building an RPM file out of a data structure.

This package requires the following packages not in Fedora:

* [ghc-conduit-combinators](../ghc-conduit-combinators)
* [ghc-lzma-conduit](../ghc-lzma-conduit)
