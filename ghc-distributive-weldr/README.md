This is distributive-0.5.3, built with "-weldr" slapped on to the end of the
name so that it doesn't interfere with the version of distributive available in
Fedora. This package was created because distributive was broken in Fedora for
a while, so we rebuilt the newest version and now we're sticking with it.

This package does not require anything not available in Fedora.
